# Objectives 

## Foundational knowledge & Performance skills
In French 1050 through 2020, you will develop your ability to communicate in French through speech and writing about a diverse set of topics. After completing the intermediate level, you will be prepared to begin advanced coursework for the French major or minor, and you will be ready to travel, study, and engage in internships abroad in order to deepen your command of the French language and understanding of the cultures of the French-speaking world.  

## Practical and Creative thinking
Communication in a foreign language involves many interconnected skills, i.e. understanding what you are reading or hearing, interpreting the meaning of those words within specific social, cultural, historical, and aesthetic contexts, and then formulating and expressing thoughts that respond to all of this. 

## Teamwork & Multicultural awareness
Your language learning allows you to begin to engage in intentional cross-cultural relationships with others. Building cross-cultural and cross-linguistic connections through language study will develop your ability to pose and solve problems collaboratively as well as to design and share information for global communities.

## Digital literacy
In your e-portfolio you will track your progress, engage in a reflective and peer-reviewing practices that augment learning both individually and as a community. Also, learning to publish your work with an authentic audience in mind, you will learn how to position yourself as learner and build your online identity.
