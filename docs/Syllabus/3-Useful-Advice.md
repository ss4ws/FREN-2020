# Some useful advice 

## Be engaged
Be engaged with your classmates and instructor and with the resources available. Learning in general and a language in particular is a community endeavor.  

## Be present
Come to class on time and be present. Physical and mental presence will enhance your learning and that of your classmates. 

## Pay attention
Being as focus as possible, stowing away distractions during class and during your daily learning activities will contribute to your progress. 

## Scaffolding 
Learning a language require small assignments but also activities that build on one another. Sometimes it feels like a lot to keep track of, but staying organized will contribute to your progress. 

## Be calm
Youâ€™ll make the most progress when not worried about sounding silly or about not understanding every word. It is normal to feel overwhelmed but keep in mind that making (and learning from) lots of mistakes is part of foreign language acquisition. The contemplative approach used in this course will help you sustain this mind set.
