# What will you do in FREN 1050?  

You will listen, speak, read, and write French to develop these skills at the elementary level, moving from the novice to the low intermediate level of proficiency in French while also developing your understanding of the Francophone world. To give you as much immersion in the language as possible, FREN 1050 is conducted entirely in French. 

Given the cumulative and communicative nature of language learning, your success depends on your engagement, presence, attention to detail and overall disposition. 

FREN 1050 is designed for students with about three years of previous French study in high school. (You may take FREN 1020 instead, if you prefer a more focused review on the 2nd half of the elementary French curriculum rather than the quicker but more comprehensive review in 1050.) If you feel that your placement into FREN 1050/1020 by test score is lower than warranted, based on your background, we urge you to visit a FREN 2010 class in the first week of the semester to see if the intermediate course (which incorporates a lot of review) will be a better fit for you.
