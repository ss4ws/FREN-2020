# What is an e-portfolio?
An e-portfolio is your personal learning space. Overtime, it will include evidence of your learning and growth. It is a place where you can start building your online learning identity. Through your collection of files and reflections you will be able to show to a variety of audiences your learning trajectory, and your aspirations for the future.

## A multimodal collection of files
Your e-portfolio is a collection of files you will generate during your learning experience. At the end of the semester it will include text, images, video, audio, links etc. 

## A Non-linear hypertext 
Your e-portfolio can be read/navigated from any point of entry.

## Integrated
Its pieces of evidence are interrelated and connected.

## A space of reflection 
In your e-portfolio you will have the opportunity to reflect on your learning and yourself as a learner.
