# Cultural Project Guidelines for FREN 2020 – FALL 2019

## What is the Culture Project?

The goal of this project is to allow you to explore, respond to, and deepen your understanding of the many aspects of global Francophone culture. This project asks you to explore the differences between your own culture and those of the Francophone world. We will ask you to reflect on how issues that are relevant to Francophone culture can also speak to your interests, both academic and personal. By the end of this project, you will be able to ask and answer thoughtful questions about a specific Francophone cultural topic, and share your interest and knowledge about this topic with the class.  This project will allow you to further develop skills to become a linguistically proficient, culturally competent, and thoughtful global citizen.

This project will be completed in a series of different steps with a partner, and will culminate with an in-class presentation and activity at the end of the semester.  Each step of the project will build your knowledge of your chosen topic, as well as the skills you use to analyze and present your topic.  

## Steps of the Culture Project:

### Étape 1: Topic proposal. 
A short written post on your Eportfolio where you discuss why you and your partner chose your topic and pose three questions you are interested in exploring about this topic.  Your topic proposal should be general, ie, “election systems”—something that you can ask lots of questions about.  You’ll tailor your topic to a more specific example in Étape 2.  

### Étape 2: Exposé. 
Prepare a digital “poster” that combines image and text to describe and present a specific example of your topic.  This example must be taken from a Francophone context.  For example, if you chose the topic “Election systems,” you might choose to present on how elections function in Québec.  You and your partner will present your exposé to a small group of your peers in class just after Fall Break.

### Tâche écrite 2. 
After your exposé presentation, you’ll write your second tâche écrite of the semester, in which your compare the French or Francophone example that you presented in the exposé to a similar example in your own culture.  This composition will be written individually, without your partner.   For example, if your exposé was a presentation of elections in Québec, then you might choose to compare the presidential election in the United States to the election of the Prime Minister in Canada for your composition topic.  Your partner might choose to write about how Congressional elections in the US compare to those for the Assemblée Nationale in Québec.

### Étape 3: Problématique et bibliographie. 
After having practiced your cultural comparison skills in Tâche 2, you and your partner will now research your topic and compile a bibliography to deepen your understanding of the relevant issues.  You will then ask a thoughtful, debatable question about your topic.  For example: “Are the elections in Québec more or less representative than those in the United States?”


### Étape 4: In-class presentation, activity, and discussion.
In this final presentation, you and your partner will answer one of the questions that you proposed in étape 3 of the project.  Your answer must be a well-supported and debatable thesis statement.  For example: “Yes, elections are more representative in Québec than in the United States.”  You’ll give a five-minute presentation with a visual support (ie, Powerpoint or video), followed by an interactive class activity.

**Detailed instructions and guidelines for each component of the Culture project will be distributed to you over the course of the semester.**  

### Assessment
Your final grade for the Culture Project counts for fifteen percent of your course grade.  This grade will be based on the quality of each assignment that you submit throughout the semester, your active engagement with classmates in this on-line environment, and your final in-class presentation.  The grade for the project will be determined according to the following percentages:

- Étape 1: Topic proposal (10%)
- Étape 2: Exposé (30%)

- Tâche écrite 2
    - Étape 3: Problématique + bibliography (10%)  
	- Étape 4: Final in class presentation (50%) 
	
_(N.B.—Tâche 2 will be included in the “tâche écrite” percentage of your course grade)._
