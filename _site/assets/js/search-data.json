Teamwork &amp; Multicultural awareness Your language learning allows you to begin to engage in intentional cross-cultural relationships with others. Building cross-cultural and cross-linguistic connections through language study will develop your ability to pose and solve problems collaboratively as well as to design and share information for global communities.

Sometimes it feels like a lot to keep track of, but staying organized will contribute to your progress. Be calm You’ll make the most progress when not worried about sounding silly or about not understanding every word. It is normal to feel overwhelmed but keep in mind that making (and learning from) lots of mistakes is part of foreign language acquisition. The contemplative approach used in this course will help you sustain this mind set.",

    "content": "A note about this course its values and pedagogy In this course you will learn French (see also the Syllabus section). Similar to other college experiences, learning a foreign language can be challenging. This learning experience however, offers an opportunity for self-discovery and community building. Despite the slow and sometimes frustrating process, the result is rewarding! That’s why foreign language learning is a requirement. The guiding principles of this course: inclusiveness, collaboration and curiosity, are reinforced by contemplative and evidence-based pedagogy with e-portfolios. If these words are confusing to you at this moment, just note that they are designed to support your learning experience, and your well-being. In this course, I value your French language and culture learning, as much as I care about your transformation and growth as a person. All this will be captured on your e-portfolios. While e-portfolios are great in capturing the big picture of your work, on a more granular level you will be using A.R.T. to help you capture the day-to-day fluctuations and micro-reflections of your learning progress. With A.R.T. you will notice what you are doing, feeling, learning, on the fly. At the end of the semester with your data, you will generate a compelling visualization of your own unique trajectory that will guide your final reflection.",
