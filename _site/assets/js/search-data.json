    "title": "What is an e-portfolio?",
    "content": "ePortfolio Guidelines, FREN 2020 What is an ePortfolio? A learning ePortfolio is a collection of student work that showcases learning over time. The ePortfolio process generally includes four elements: collection: the student collects evidence of his/her learning and progress selection: the student selects those pieces of work that best represent progress or learning in a particular course reflection: the student reflects on his/her goals, strengths and weaknesses, learning processes, and/or achievement in a particular work or collection of work presentation: the student presents his/her portfolio to an authentic audience (classmates, instructor, department, employer) The ePortfolio serves to document progress and development, to highlight learning processes and tools for ongoing development, and/or to showcase a student’s best work. An ePortfolio can be used for personal, academic, or professional purposes. Why create an ePortfolio in a foreign language class? In creating an ePortfolio, you will be able to document your progress and learning as a second language speaker within the course and throughout the rest of the language sequence, by collecting your work, reflecting on your development, and showcasing your learning. Your ePortfolio will contribute to the knowledge building of the whole class, provide a more holistic assessment of your linguistic and cultural competence, and present a more global picture of your skills and achievements to future employers. In fact, “more than 4 in 5 employers say an electronic portfolio would be useful to them in ensuring that job applicants have the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in their company or organization” (AACU, It Takes More than a Major: Employer Priorities for College Learning and Student Success). The language-learning ePortfolio will allow students to: make links between language study and other academic and non-academic interests and pursuits make links between: (a) components of a course; (b) learning in class, at home, and online; (c) one language course and the next develop an awareness of their progress, learning styles, goals in acquiring a second language, and tools for lifelong learning; develop a capacity for self-assessment of their progress and for critical reflection on their learning strategies archive their work and track their progress over time select multimedia artifacts that allow for a more multimodal and holistic assessment of second language development, including listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills, and improved mastery of the linguistic system select and present evidence documenting development of cultural competence and cross-cultural awareness publish work in a public forum and for an authentic audience engage in a critically reflective, collaborative process that augments learning as a community knowledge-building endeavor develop digital literacy skills construct and present an online language learner identity Components The components of the ePortfolio outlined below have been carefully designed to promote the attainment of the learning goals described above. Your FREN 2020 ePortfolio will include the following: Mon profil A brief individual profile, in writing and/or on video, en français, bien sûr. Please post your profile in your Digication portfolio by the end of the 2nd week of the semester. Travaux d’écriture: examples of formal written work Tâches écrites (including the draft for the first two assignments and the final version of all three) A brief reflection on your writing process for the first “tâche écrite.” This reflection will be posted in the comments section of the “Travaux d’écritures” page after the final version of Tâche 1. At least one of your “tâche” will be related to the culture project (see below) and thus may be posted in the “Projet culturel” section of your ePortfolio, but with a link provided within this section to document the development of your writing skills. Expression orale: examples of spoken French Videos submitted for each “tâche orale” Videos for homework assignments Recorded journal entries. Audio or video recordings completed for the culture project (see below) will be posted in that section of your ePortfolio, but linked to or reposted in this section to document the development of your speaking skills. Journal Periodic short written journal entries on cultural topics related to the course materials and/or the student’s personal, academic, and professional interests written and oral comments on and responses to classmates’ work, according to the guidelines distributed in class by the instructor See further instructions at the end of this document. Projet culturel The goal of this project is to allow you to discover and to deepen your understanding of an aspect of global Francophone culture of particular interest to you. This project calls for you to explore differences between Francophone cultures and your own or between different French speaking cultures through the lens of one cultural topic or question, and then to reflect on the connections between these unique cultural perspectives and your other personal or academic interests. You will work collaboratively on this project with one of your classmates. The project culminates in a final presentation that includes an audio-visual element as well as a class activity that you will lead with your partner. You will collect and present most of your work on the culture project within your Digication ePortfolio. All the work that you produce for your culture project with your partner should appear on each of your individual ePortfolios. Mon dictionnaire** Development of a personal dictionary of words and phrases encountered during the semester that you wish to make part of your active vocabulary See further instructions at the end of this document. Réflexions Réflexion initiale Please write a paragraph (in English) describing your personal goals for this course. To be posted by the end of the second week of the semester, as soon as you have set up your Digication ePortfolio. Autres réflexions Over the course of the semester, you will write reflections and self-assessments of your written and oral work, development of cultural competency, learning strategies, goals, and progress. Réflexion finale At the end of the semester, you will write a final paragraph (in English) assessing your progress during the course, goals achieved, new questions raised, and future language learning plans. Commentaires** This page will serve as a repository for all of the comments that you leave on your peers’ ePortfolios. You will be asked to leave substantive and thoughtful comments on other students work, including compositions, journals, culture projects, etc. Your instructor will distribute additional guidelines for some of these components. How to set up your e-portfolio ePortfolio Tool You will create your Foreign Language ePortfolio using Digication, an ePortfolio management system embedded in Collab. To create your ePortfolio, follow the steps below: Log in to your course site in Collab. Click on the Digication tool in the left-hand margin of Collab. It will open a new “Welcome to Digication” window for your class. Click on the Green Plus sign button to create your ePortfolio. Select the student template shared with your class, then click on the “Use this template” option in the box that appears. &gt; Then click on the blue “+” sign button at the top, to “Create new eportfolio based on this template.” &gt; Provide the title of your new ePortfolio. (Be sure to include your name in the title.) &gt; Click on the blue “Create” button on the bottom righthand corner of the screen. When you “publish changes” (to save your new ePortfolio to the course), you will see that the default settings are that your ePortfolio is private to you, but also shared with your class. Simply click “Save settings and published” to retain the default settings. (If you wish, you can change the settings later to allow your ePortfolio to be viewed by any UVA Digication user or by the general public.) Your portfolio will then appear on the Welcome to Digication page for your class, as well as on your own Digication homepage (“dashboard”). Edit your ePortfolio following the directions in the Digication Quick-Start Guide for Users. If you have any problems, get in touch with the ePPC ePortfolio Peer Consultants. You can also direct technical questions to Digication Help Desk, or write to eportfolios@virginia.edu. For more information on ePortfolios, check out the Learning Design &amp; Technology website at http://learningdesign.as.virginia.edu/eportfolio More about two of the ePortfolio components: Journal You will write or record a minimum of SIX brief entries in the Journal category of your ePortfolio over the semester, according to the schedule announced by your instructor. This will be an informal written commentary on an online source you’ve read, listened to, or watched in relation to the lesson themes in response to a prompt assigned by your instructor. For commentaries on Internet sources, please visit French/francophone news/culture sites of interest to you (an article, exhibit, news broadcast, video, etc.) on the Internet. You may wish to begin with the list of recommended sites below and posted on the course ePortfolio: sites à consulter: www.rfi.fr www.lemonde.fr www.lesinrocks.com www.jeuneafrique.com linternaute.com tv5.org http://frenchfries.blog.lemonde.fr/ —Blog d’un étudiant de Sciences Po–Lyon qui a étudié à l’Université de Virginie en 2014-15. Ça vous intéressera peut-être de lire ses réflexions et ses explications de ce qu’il a vécu et observé ici. http://phonetique.free.fr/ — exercices de phonétique http://www.lexilogos.com/- francais_langue_dictionnaires.htm—Pour accéder à une grande collection de dictionnaires (modernes et historiques) de la langue française After reading/viewing/listening to the material you have selected or that your instructor has assigned, please write a paragraph of at least 8 sentences to explain your selection and what you’ve gleaned from it (about culture, language, anything) or to respond to your instructor’s question about the source text/video. Post your paragraph, along with a link to your selected source, under the “journal” category of your ePortfolio. You will also be responsible for reading and commenting on journal entries by your classmates. This will serve as a journal entry on your individual ePortfolio, but if you find an article or media resource that you think would interest others in the class, I urge you to post the link and your comments on the course ePortfolio. Timely completion and overall quality of your journal entries will be evaluated in the final ePortfolio rubric. The communication of content in these informal writing assignments is more important than grammatical or lexical precision, but we do expect students to pay attention to basic grammatical forms, verb tenses, and spelling, and to follow the accepted rules of citation of sources. Mon dictionnaire In this component of your ePortfolio you will develop a personal dictionary of words and phrases encountered during the semester (outside of the required vocabulary lists in the textbook) that you wish to make part of your active vocabulary. These may be words or expressions used in your formal or informal writing or encountered in a web site or textbook resources that you use when preparing your journal entries or working on other assignments/projects. You are required to add 4-5 words per lesson/chapter, with a minimum of 20 words/expressions by the end of the semester. When you add words/expressions to your dictionnaire, be sure to include the definition in English (or French, if you prefer). You may also wish to include the context or sentence where you first discovered the word/expression.",

After completing the intermediate level, you will be prepared to begin advanced coursework for the French major or minor, and you will be ready to travel, study, and engage in internships abroad in order to deepen your command of the French language and understanding of the cultures of the French-speaking world. Practical and Creative thinking Communication in a foreign language involves many interconnected skills, i.e. understanding what you are reading or hearing, interpreting the meaning of those words within specific social, cultural, historical, and aesthetic contexts, and then formulating and expressing thoughts that respond to all of this. Teamwork &amp; Multicultural awareness Your language learning allows you to begin to engage in intentional cross-cultural relationships with others. Building cross-cultural and cross-linguistic connections through language study will develop your ability to pose and solve problems collaboratively as well as to design and share information for global communities. Digital literacy In your e-portfolio you will track your progress, engage in a reflective and peer-reviewing practices that augment learning both individually and as a community. Also, learning to publish your work with an authentic audience in mind, you will learn how to position yourself as learner and build your online identity.",

    "title": "Cultural Project",
    "content": "Cultural Project Guidelines for FREN 2020 – FALL 2019 What is the Culture Project? The goal of this project is to allow you to explore, respond to, and deepen your understanding of the many aspects of global Francophone culture. This project asks you to explore the differences between your own culture and those of the Francophone world. We will ask you to reflect on how issues that are relevant to Francophone culture can also speak to your interests, both academic and personal. By the end of this project, you will be able to ask and answer thoughtful questions about a specific Francophone cultural topic, and share your interest and knowledge about this topic with the class. This project will allow you to further develop skills to become a linguistically proficient, culturally competent, and thoughtful global citizen. This project will be completed in a series of different steps with a partner, and will culminate with an in-class presentation and activity at the end of the semester. Each step of the project will build your knowledge of your chosen topic, as well as the skills you use to analyze and present your topic. Steps of the Culture Project: Étape 1: Topic proposal. A short written post on your Eportfolio where you discuss why you and your partner chose your topic and pose three questions you are interested in exploring about this topic. Your topic proposal should be general, ie, “election systems”—something that you can ask lots of questions about. You’ll tailor your topic to a more specific example in Étape 2. Étape 2: Exposé. Prepare a digital “poster” that combines image and text to describe and present a specific example of your topic. This example must be taken from a Francophone context. For example, if you chose the topic “Election systems,” you might choose to present on how elections function in Québec. You and your partner will present your exposé to a small group of your peers in class just after Fall Break. Tâche écrite 2. After your exposé presentation, you’ll write your second tâche écrite of the semester, in which your compare the French or Francophone example that you presented in the exposé to a similar example in your own culture. This composition will be written individually, without your partner. For example, if your exposé was a presentation of elections in Québec, then you might choose to compare the presidential election in the United States to the election of the Prime Minister in Canada for your composition topic. Your partner might choose to write about how Congressional elections in the US compare to those for the Assemblée Nationale in Québec. Étape 3: Problématique et bibliographie. After having practiced your cultural comparison skills in Tâche 2, you and your partner will now research your topic and compile a bibliography to deepen your understanding of the relevant issues. You will then ask a thoughtful, debatable question about your topic. For example: “Are the elections in Québec more or less representative than those in the United States?” Étape 4: In-class presentation, activity, and discussion. In this final presentation, you and your partner will answer one of the questions that you proposed in étape 3 of the project. Your answer must be a well-supported and debatable thesis statement. For example: “Yes, elections are more representative in Québec than in the United States.” You’ll give a five-minute presentation with a visual support (ie, Powerpoint or video), followed by an interactive class activity. Detailed instructions and guidelines for each component of the Culture project will be distributed to you over the course of the semester. Assessment Your final grade for the Culture Project counts for fifteen percent of your course grade. This grade will be based on the quality of each assignment that you submit throughout the semester, your active engagement with classmates in this on-line environment, and your final in-class presentation. The grade for the project will be determined according to the following percentages: Étape 1: Topic proposal (10%) Étape 2: Exposé (30%) Tâche écrite 2 Étape 3: Problématique + bibliography (10%) Étape 4: Final in class presentation (50%) (N.B.—Tâche 2 will be included in the “tâche écrite” percentage of your course grade).",

Comment allez-vous? Je m’appelle Spyro Simotas et je serai votre enseignant ce semestre. Je suis étudiant mais aussi lecteur de Français au Département de Français à UVA. Je n’ai pas beaucoup voyagé cet été. Je n’ai même pas du tout voyagé cet été. Pourquoi? Parce que je suis en train de finir ma thèse et je suis très stressé. Et vous est-ce que vous avez passé des bonnes vacances? Est-ce que vous avez voyagé? Qui est allé en France cet été? Qui est allé dans un pays francophone? Où est-ce que vous êtes allés? Pour mieux se connaître… Activité orale, avec un partenaire. Trouvez un partenaire et posez alternativement les questions suivantes: Comment t’appelles-tu? D’où viens-tu? (Ville, État, Pays etc) Tu est étudiant en quelle année? Qu’est-ce que tu étudies? Est-ce que tu joues aux sports? Lesquels? Est-ce que tu joues d’un instrument de musique? Lequel? Quel est ton endroit favori à Charlottesville? Quel est ton plat favori? Est-ce que tu as des frères et sœurs? Combien? Quels âge ont-ils? Qu’est-ce qui t’intéresse à la culture française et francophone? (la mode la gastronomie, la littérature, le cinéma, la langue, etc). Pourquoi? Syllabus “Chasse au trésor” Travaillez en groupes de trois. Quel groupe trouvera toutes les réponses en premier? What is the date of the final exam? How many DRAFTS of compositions will you write in this class? How many unexcused absences are you allowed? Why is it important to be on class in time? Is the culture project conducted individually or in a group? What is the best way to choose a partner for your cultural project? What is the best way to use Google Translate in your compositions? ART What is ART? ART is a tracker that brings awareness to the minutiae of your learning progress. Although there is always growth in learning, the path itself is not always a straight line, much less an ascending one. Setbacks and frustration will be partners in your journey, as much as satisfaction and victory. With ART I am asking you to be honest, and record both in order to trace your unique path to success.

You will each get a copy of the limited edition poster, plus you will also get to have your own piece of the printing plate to take with you from the printing lab! You can each sign your contribution to the poster. I’m planning on giving copies of the poster to the French department, the Jefferson Trust, Rare Book School, and a private donor—who are all sponsoring this special event for you. As its name suggests, ART is more than a statistical tool. It offers you a visual representation of your progress in class aiming to enhance your final reflection. Consequently, it is part of the completion of your e-portfolio. My pedagogical goal is to end the semester by giving you more than just a final grade. My hope is that by guiding you through the process of tracking your progress, you will get to know more, not only about French language and culture, but also about yourself. This final printing project will be included as part of your final portfolio, as it is meant to be the culmination of all these experiences. The printing lab, is a new learning and making experience that I hope will be inspiring and fulfilling for you.

    "content": "A note about this course its values and pedagogy In this course you will learn French (see also the Syllabus section). Similar to other college experiences, learning a foreign language can be challenging. This learning experience however, offers an opportunity for self-discovery and community building. Despite the slow and sometimes frustrating process, the result is rewarding! That’s why foreign language learning is a requirement. The guiding principles of this course: inclusiveness, collaboration and curiosity, are reinforced by contemplative and evidence-based pedagogy with e-portfolios. If these words are confusing to you at this moment, just note that they are designed to support your learning experience, and your well-being. In this course, I value your French language and culture learning, as much as I care about your growth as a person. All this will be captured on your e-portfolios. While e-portfolios are great in capturing the big picture of your work, on a more granular level you will be using A.R.T. to help you capture the day-to-day fluctuations and micro-reflections of your learning progress. With A.R.T. you will notice what you are doing, feeling, learning, on the fly. At the end of the semester with your data, you will generate a compelling visualization of your own unique trajectory that will guide your final reflection.",
