# A note about this course its values and pedagogy

In this course you will learn French (more about that in the [Syllabus]()). Similar to other college experiences, learning a foreign language can be challenging. This learning experience however, offers an opportunity for self-discovery and community building. Despite the slow and sometimes frustrating process, the result is rewarding! Thatâ€™s why foreign language learning is a requirement. The guiding principles of this course: inclusiveness, collaboration and curiosity, are reinforced by contemplative [LINK to meditation] and evidence-based pedagogy with e-portfolios [LINK]. If these words are confusing to you at this moment, just note that they are designed to support your learning experience, and your well-being. For example, in this course, I value your French language and culture learning, as much as I care about your transformation and growth as a person. All this will be captured on your e-portfolios. While e-portfolios are great in capturing the big picture of your work, on a more granular level you will be using [A.R.T.]() to help you capture the day-to-day fluctuations and micro-reflections of your learning progress. With A.R.T. you will notice what you are doing, feeling, learning, on the fly. With your data, you will generate a compelling [visualization]() of your own unique trajectory that will guide your final reflection.
