# A note about this course its values and pedagogy

In this course you will learn French (see also the Syllabus section). Similar to other college experiences, learning a foreign language can be challenging. This learning experience however, offers an opportunity for self-discovery and community building. Despite the slow and sometimes frustrating process, the result is rewarding! That’s why foreign language learning is a requirement. The guiding principles of this course: inclusiveness, collaboration and curiosity, are reinforced by contemplative and evidence-based pedagogy with e-portfolios. If these words are confusing to you at this moment, just note that they are designed to support your learning experience, and your well-being. In this course, I value your French language and culture learning, as much as I care about your growth as a person. All this will be captured on your e-portfolios. While e-portfolios are great in capturing the big picture of your work, on a more granular level you will be using A.R.T. to help you capture the day-to-day fluctuations and micro-reflections of your learning progress. With [A.R.T.](https://ss4ws.github.io//FREN-1050/docs/) you will notice what you are doing, feeling, learning, on the fly. At the end of the semester with your data, you will generate a compelling [visualization](https://ss4ws.github.io/blog/2019/VSF-PRES/#/9) of your own unique trajectory that will guide your final reflection.
